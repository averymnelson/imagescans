Steps for V2
-After database is set up for price scraping run the collected part number from this project through it to ensure it is a valid file name.
 if not, move to errors instead of renaming. 
-find a better method for taking pictures of barcodes such that less photos fail. might look into a scanning app like camscanner
 or see if another image processing method is more effective than thresholding. Possibly key up contrast after one of these steps?
